# Fork
This is a fork of the master repository as of version 1.2.3. As such it is missing many of the features of the original program however i have made changes to make it more useful for Australian users. There are other changes but i really can't be bothered listing them so if you want to know then download and compile the code and see for your self.

# TODO
 - Check captcha support (fix image not displaying)
 - Add series (customizable if cant get from audible)

## Building
OpenAudible is a java application that uses Maven for building.

### Prerequisites
Java 8, Maven, and git. Windows, Mac or Linux Desktop.

Clone the [git repo](https://github.com/openaudible/openaudible)

```
git clone https://github.com/openaudible/openaudible.git
```

#### Build using Intellij
Import Project: <br />
Select the openaudible/pom.xml file <br />
Click through all of the defaults

#### Build using Eclipse
Import... Maven Project<br />
Select the openaudible directory<br />

#### Build from command line (requires maven, java 8 SDK)

```
cd openaudible
mvn compile
mvn package
```
## Running/Debugging

Your IDE should link the platform specific SWT library via the maven profile.
SWT is the eclipse widget library, used by Eclipse IDE and other apps. It has a
jar file for each platform mac, win64, and linux.


#### IntelliJ
Select menu Run: Debug...  <br />
Select Edit Configurations... <br />
Add Application <br />
Name: OpenAudible <br />
Main Class: org.openaudible.desktop.Application <br />
VM options: -ea <br />
Mac VM options: -ea -XstartOnFirstThread <br />
Click Debug button <br />

#### Windows Command Line
```
java -cp "target\openaudible-jar-with-dependencies.jar;swt\org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64-4.6.jar" org.openaudible.desktop.Application
```

#### Mac Command Line
```
java -XstartOnFirstThread -cp "./target/openaudible-jar-with-dependencies.jar:./swt/org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.x86_64-4.6.jar" org.openaudible.desktop.Application
```
Notice on Mac, the -XstartOnFirstThread is required to run SWT apps.

#### Linux Command Line
```
java -cp "target/openaudible-jar-with-dependencies.jar:swt/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_64-4.6.jar" org.openaudible.desktop.Application
```

#### Notes

Running with -ea to alert you of assertion failures is recommended for debugging. We use "asserts" to help identify problems.

Enter that into the VM Arguments on your debugger/run dialog if using an IDE.

You should see the user interface. You may see an error, or a warning about where you can go to preferences and enter your audible account details.

Open the Preferences from the Edit Menu. <br />
Enter your audible user name (email) and password. <br />
Before logging in with the application, go to the Controls: Browser menu and log into your audible account. <br />
This is only required if logging in fails or if the browser cookies expire. <br />

The application will use cookies to expedite logging in-- and bypassing some of the "are you a human" checks.

Errors are logged to the console window, under the File menu.

Some effort was made to separate the SWT GUI from the core code, which can be used in other projects or using another front end. Maybe someone wants to port the app to Swing or Electron.

## Built With

- [Eclipse SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) - Standard Widget Toolkit
- [HTML Unit](https://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/) - HTML web page scraping
- [InAudible-NG](https://github.com/inAudible-NG/) - Decode

## Contributing

While stable, OpenAudible is always looking for improvements, testing and bug reporting for all platforms. Community support of all kinds is essential and greatly appreciated. 

- Donation of an [Open Source code signing certificate](https://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml) would be nice.
- Exporting to a podcast format is being considered
- Testing and feedback with regions is needed
- Exporting to a format that supports the best mobile and linux audio book players is the goal.
- Are chapters working well in your favorite audio book player?
- UI improvement ideas welcome, especially for Linux.
- The in-app [help documentation](https://github.com/openaudible/openaudible/tree/master/src/main/help) is not great and ugly.  
- Support for multiple audible accounts would be nice
